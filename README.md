        This message is for my one and only Buddy, Best friend, Girlfriend, Fiancee, and lastly my Wife, my beautiful Wife. First of all, thank you for staying even if this past month isn't for us, for our relationship. I love you so much just for that, mahal. Second, I wanna say thank you because na titimpi mo yung pagiging bata ko sayo, pagiging mataray ko minsan. I love you for accepting me for who I am. I don't need to change my own personality when I'm with you; I don't need to change my own voice; I don't have to make it sound more fem para lang maging comfortable ka. Thank you for putting up with me, mahal; I'm really, really grateful for that. Mahal ko, I love youuu!! üéÄ. Mahal, I'm really grateful God gave me a path, a chance towards you. Those memories, you're with me; I will always cherish that. I will tell it to our kids pa, kung pano ka nag papansin sakin sa story üòù. You deserve to be treated like a princess; you deserve to be treated like you're the last woman on earth. I LOVE YOU SO MUCHH!! üéÄüéÄ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. I can't believe I'm doing all this; this is my first time doing this kind of thing. They say, being apart from your partner is hard, it's boring. You can fall out of love even. But sa akin, I guess it's different. No kidding! Everyday that passes, every month, I JUST FELL HARDER AND HARDER, MY GODDD!! I will make sure that you and Rein will have a wealthy life under my roof. I will love you both forever, my lovee. Miel, you are my everything. You bring every luck in my life; your voice is the music I wanna hear every boring situation. Every time when I'm outside, ikaw ang pinaka important sa akin and don't you dare forget that, mahal. Thank you for being with me even with that hectic schedule you have; thank you for giving me time. I love youuu! I hope your mom likes me, hehe. Kidding aside, I love you, mahal. I plan our future; the next step is to take action by pursuing my studies and my job to make my dream with you and Rein come to life. I love youuu; thank you for being there when I need you most. Thank you so much; you deserve everything, my love. You deserve every act of kindness known to man. I love you till every star in the universe falls. One day, one day!! I will be able to get down on my knees in front of the altar and ask, 'Will you marry me, Miel?' I love you, baby :)
